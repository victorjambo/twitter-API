# Ruby Twitter Examples

A set of Python scripts to demonstrate interactions with the Twitter API

## Usage

You will need to authenticate with Twitter to use these scripts. To do so, sign up for developer credentials and create a Twitter app here:

`https://apps.twitter.com/`

You can create access credentials directly through Twitter's web interface, authorized under the username you used to create the app.
